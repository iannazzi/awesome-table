## Tests
  Setting up the testing tooling was a bit of a nightmare... so what I did is built the tests into the demo pages, and output success if they all pass. You can manually verify these tests by going to the individual pages and checking the test status at the bottom.
  
  I use nightwatch to run automated testing, however all this is doing is verifying the tests pass in the demo pages. To make it work you need selenium and the browser drivers for the browser you want to test. Checkout the documentation at nightwatch.io. 
  
  `npm test`
